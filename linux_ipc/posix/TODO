1) In the end i settled on REDIS actually ( i avoided the clustered solution )

Simply and effectively single threaded.. (to avoid duplicity) Offers a atomic BlockonPop or even a multicast pubsubhubbub feature for queue workers..

a homegrown solution was developed to manage "lost jobs" that never arrived.. ( reliability )

Its quite a simple model actually.. seemingly easy to maintain aswell..


2)  RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ
